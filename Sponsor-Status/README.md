# Sponsor Status

I am not enabling sponsors for this project, as I don't feel comfortable doing so here, as I feel it would be inappropriate. My politics shouldn't be earning money, and I don't want to be a politician. Also, it is against GitHubs Terms of Service to have a sponsor button on political projects.

## Past

I recently had to remove the sponsor button on April 22nd 2021. I don't know why I added it in the first place.
